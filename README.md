# TICTACTOE
This code allows two players to play Tic-Tac-Toe in the terminal. It includes features like input validation, checking for winners, and determining when the game ends in a draw. The game board updates after each move, and players take turns placing their symbols (X or O). Let me know if you'd like additional features or enhancements!
